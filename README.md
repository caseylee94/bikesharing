# Analysis of Bike Sharing Feasibility for Des Moines

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze CitiBike data gathered from NYC to determine the demographics and typical uses of CitiBikes. This will help determine if a CitiBike program will do well and be economically feasible for Des Moines, Idaho. Tablesu Public was used to build the graphics into a story, which is linked below:

## Analysis

The data set analyzed in this project was taken from the month of August of use of Citi Bikes across NYC. It included age demographics, gender, trip duration, starting and ending location, customer vs subscriber, and various other metrics. The first analysis conducted was a general analysis of some of the basics of the data, as shown below:

 *Screen capture from story showing the peak bike riding hours for August, the total number of riders, customers versus subscribers, and gender breakdown of riders.*
 
The peak riding time is from 7:00pm - 8:00pm and another smaller peak at 8:00am. This is to be expected considering these are the typical work commute times. The majority of riders are subscribers, meaning they have subscriptions to Citi Bikes, versus customers which are users without subscriptions. This is interesting because it shows that repeat customers are the majority of bike riders so an appealing subscription program seems to be a key to having a successful Citi Bike program. Also the majority of riders are males, this could be important for advertising demographics.
 
 Next analyzed were the top starting and ending locations as well as trip duration by age, as shown below:
